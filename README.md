I have created a website using OpenWeather API and tried to access their data using API keys and able to get their details like latitude,longitude,climate etc.
I created a index.ejs file
Public folder for static files like styles.css and weather.css
views folder for index.ejs and weather.ejs
I used axios for getting the data from external API✌️
I also used EJS for creating dynamic websites✌️
I used node.js and express.js and implemented my knowledge of API's🤖
Disclaimer:This may look simple but I gained a lot of knowledge and experience by doing this project from scratch😇
